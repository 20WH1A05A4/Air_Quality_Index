# Air_Quality_Index

The field of air quality forecasting is by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The dataset is organised to capture the concentrations of several pollutants gases as input parameters for Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. After a thorough comparison analysis of the dataset with models such as KNN, gradient booster, linear regression, decision tree, SVM, and LSTM, it is shown that LSTM is the most effective in providing increased predicted accuracy. The project also has a strong security mechanism that includes login and user registration capabilities, strengthened by the generation of OTP using email authentication. By allowing users to enter important parameters such the name of the city, the country, and the goal date for AQI prognostication, the user interface simplifies the procedure. Then, with ease, the interface then smoothly displays the predicted AQI value for the given date, improving use and accessibility.
